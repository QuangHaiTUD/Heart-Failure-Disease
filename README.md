# Heart Failure Clinical Records Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing clinical records related to heart failure. The dataset used in this project aims to provide insights into factors contributing to heart failure and to build predictive models for early detection.

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Summary statistics and visualizations of clinical features.
  - Identification of correlations and potential risk factors.

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Handling missing values.
  - Normalization and encoding of categorical variables.

- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - Training and evaluation of models to predict heart failure outcomes.
  - Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

- **Visualization:**
  - Charts and graphs for understanding model performance and feature importance.
